# Active sinking particles

## Repo for Active sinking particles project.
### Collaboration between Prakash Lab, Stanford and Pepper Lab, U of Puget Sound. 

Sinking particles in marine, freshwater and man-made environments, including seawage treatment plants, are a hot-spots of biological activity. How does this biological activity change the fate of these particles? How do protists including sessile filter feeders such as vorticella, change the flow and mass transport characteristics to these particles? What factors control the physical properties as well as biological communities aboard these sinking sinking ecosystems? This is a fascinating problem at the interface of fluid mechanics, transport, protistology, microbiology and ecology. Here we leverage Scale-free vertical tracking micrpscopy aka Gravity machine and model active sinking particles to capture the first-ever multi-scale view into this complex system.
